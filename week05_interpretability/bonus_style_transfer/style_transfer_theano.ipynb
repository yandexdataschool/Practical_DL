Gatys suggests to dismiss spatial information by computing correlations between the feature maps $F$. If $F$ has dimensions `CxWxH`, then correlation matrix will be `CxC`, and look there's no spatial dimentions. So the style term will be responsible for mathing these correlation (Gram) matrices. \n",

    "#### A little bit of history behind this texture generation method\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually the idea comes from 90th, when mathematical models of texures were developed \\[3\\]. They defined a probabolistic model for texture generation. They used an idea, that two images are indeed two samples of a particular texture iff their statistics match. The statistics used are histograms of given texture $I$ filtered with a number of filters: $\\{hist(F_i * I), \\quad i = 1,\\dots, k\\}$. And whatever image has the same statistics is thought as a sample of texture $I$. The main drawback was the Gibbs sampling was employed (which is very slow). \\[4\\] suggested exactly the scheme we use now: starting from a random image, let's adjust its statistics iteratively so they match the desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what is changed: the filters. \\[4\\] used carefully crafted set of filters, and now we use neural network based non-linear filters. We still use the idea of matching statistics, but the statistics improved. \n",

    "- Stylize your favourite photo with your favourite style (hope you use something interesting).\n",
    "- Give an explanation for matching Gram matrices. What does it mean to minimize distance between them in terms of random variables? Assume a true distripution $P$, and model distibution $Q$. What class does $Q$ belong when matching gram matrices? Show, that $KL (P || Q)$ is minimized when Gram matrices are matched. In other words you need to come up with $Q$ such that $KL$ divergence is minimized when models gram matrix is equal to a target Gram matix.

Actually, $Gram$ matrix or $Mean$ or $Mean$ + $Covariance$ matrix can be thought as texture descriptors. Does $mean$ encoding have enough parameters to represent texures?  \n",
    "- ***OR*** come up with your method to remove spatial information instead of above.\n",
    "- Bonus: you can mix several styles, averaging their representations. It can be fun. Some examples are [here](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second one** (hardcore):\n",
    "- Substitute gram matrices with discriminator as in GAN. That is, you match distributions matching gram matrices and discriminator is designed to match distributions. Probably $Q$, we have defined is weak or too constraintive. Neural network based discriminator should be more flexible in this sense.\n",
    "    - The procedure will be a little bit unusual: we will optimize NN inside optimization loop w.r.t. image.\n",
    "    - You need to define a pixel level discriminator (at each layer you have $WH$ objects, each with $C$ features). Basically it should decide whether a pixel came from style image or from current image $X$. \n",
    "    - So the process is like that: \n",
    "        - At each image optimization iteration update D (actually you do not need to do minibatches updates here, you can simulate fully-connected layers with 1x1 convolutions, softmax with sigmoids). You will need to find a trade-off, for how long and how frequent should updates be. \n",
    "        - Then propagate gradient just like in GAN when optimizing $G$ i.e. swap labels (another strategy is in [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/rg/papers/Tzeng_ICCV2015.pdf), eq. 4).\n",
    "        - Let L-BFGS (or whatever, probably adam will be more stable) update $X$.\n",
    "    - Discriminator architecture is up to you. It's better to start with logistic regression which should emulate $Mean$ + $Cov$ matching (isn't it?). \n",
    "    - I tried this myself without content loss only."
