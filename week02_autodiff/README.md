## Practice

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/spring23/week02_autodiff/seminar_pytorch.ipynb)

As usual, go to `seminar_pytorch.ipynb` and follow instructions from there. You will also need to pass `homework_pytorch.ipynb` for full score.

__Alternative (TensorFlow):__ a similar tutorial for tensorflow is provided in `tensorflow.ipynb`. From now on, you *can* submit assignments in any framework - but you will have to do some extra engineering in that case. However, unless you're already profficient with PyTorch, we recommend you stick to it.
