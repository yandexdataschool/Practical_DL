    "I want you to implement a simple 2D GAN game. The kind of animation, I want to see is like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeJINHjyzOU) at 15:30 or in [here](https://habrahabr.ru/post/275429/) but in 2D. You can google, search code at github, whatever, but the network should be based on Theano. \n",

    "Basically you will need to come up with true distribution $P$, say mixture of gaussians (surprise me), sample some data from it. Visualize it as a heatmap. To visualize $G$ density you can fix $N$ noise vectors $\\{z_i\\} \\quad i=1,\\dots, N$ and draw a circle for each $G(z_i)$. It is also funny to visualize discriminator as a vector field (can be done with `plt.arrow`, `plt.quiver plo). Look how it should be in the middle of [this page](http://www.inference.vc/an-alternative-update-rule-for-generative-adversarial-networks/).\n",
