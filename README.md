# Deep learning course

This repo supplements Deep Learning course taught at YSDA and HSE @spring'20. _For previous iteration visit the [fall19 branch](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/tree/fall19)._

Lecture and seminar materials for each week are in ./week* folders. Homeworks are in ./homework* folders.

# General info
* Create cloud jupyter session from this repo - [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/master)
* Telegram [chat room](https://t.me/joinchat/BZUAtEx5jCToejrzjTrrqg) (russian).
* YSDA deadlines & admin stuff can be found at the YSDA course wiki (ysda students only).
