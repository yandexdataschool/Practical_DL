# HSE_deeplearning
Fork of Lempitsky DL for HSE master students
Lecture and seminar materials for each week is in ./week* folders

# Coordinates
* The classes are currently happening on __fridays at 18.00, room 400 (CS.HSE)__. There is also a backup thread for those who __cannot__ appear in the main thread(please e-mail or PM@slack us for details).
* Course mail - deeplearninghse16@gmail.com - for homework assignments, project stuff, questions, suggestions, intimidations, etc.
* Slack group - write a.manokhina@gmail.com for slack invitation [instructors appear ~once in two days]
* Any technical issues, ideas, bugs in course materials, contribution ideas - add an [issue](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/HSE_deeplearning/issues)


# Announcements
* 17.10 - week4 partially completed seminar uploaded
* 17.10 - a way for students to reduce lateness penalty on their homework assignments [announced](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/HSE_deeplearning/wiki/Back-to-the-future)
* 14.10 - week4 lecture, seminar and homework uploaded
* 12.10 - If you sent us anything before 6-00 AM (Moscow) 12.10.16 and still got no reply / no score [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3v1CG3Y7qnvSUNNzGR6maZq0QzveWQNhRH2VcMm1fM/edit?usp=sharing) - contact us (slack, issue on github, anything) - there may be a problem with e-mail delivery.
* 12.10 - for those rare specimen who read official curriculum - we'll have have to reorder the curriculum. Advanced vision goes 2 weeks forward, advanced text gets 2 weeks sooner. The rest stays as planned.
* 7.10 - If you are considering project ideas, please contact us (slack >= mail) asap to know you exist. You don't have to know actual project topic - just tell us that you're there and you may be up to something.
* 7.10 - We've now got [da feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1HaODcG3vW7PAiQOUexZAwaZzrcGtVIYbJjymhLhgLYA/edit) - it's fully anonymous and you can send there whatever you won't send us via slack/mail.
* 7.10 - Week3 lecture notes and homework uploaded.
* 30.09 - Week2 homework (lasagne/cifar): Please do not forget to add deterministic=True for your neural network when computing accuracy (not when training)
* 30.09 - added week2 lecture and homework.
* 30.09 - published [scoreboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3v1CG3Y7qnvSUNNzGR6maZq0QzveWQNhRH2VcMm1fM/edit#gid=0)
* 23.09 - added week1 materials and homework
* 20.09 - by default we meet on __Friday at 18-00, room 400__. _if you cannot make it, please send us an e-mail (course mail) or PM me in slack ASAP - we have a second parallel available and a few other options_.
* 20.09 - HW0 deadline was shifted 1 wek into the future. Rejoice!
* 20.09 - grading info added
* 15.09 - Doodle on when do we meet - [link](http://doodle.com/poll/cygymdnkf7q5vqmm)
* 15.09 - Please get the frameworks installed by the next class - [issue](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/HSE_deeplearning/issues/1)
* 15.09 - added project rules and examples (see "course stuff" below)
* 15.09 - week0 assignment published (see "syllabus")
